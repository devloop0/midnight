# Midnight

A C++ template metaprogramming library that can be used to perform complex compile-time calculations easily; essentially, if you find yourself using C++ and saying, "you know what, I could use some more templates in my life," this is the library for you.

This library only deals with compile-time facilities and provides very little runtime capabilities; the library is also header-only and requires no external dependencies other than a C++11 compiler (`clang++` or `g++`) with `constexpr` support.

The main.cpp contains various usecases for this library and contains examples of most functions that are used for processing in midnight.
